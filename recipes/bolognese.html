        <h2>Instructions: </h2>
        
        <ol>
          <li>
            <ul> <!-- Preparations -->
              <li>Dice the onions, carrots and celery into small pieces</li>
              <li>Mix the beef and pork mince together</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>In a medium-large pot, saute the onion, carrot and celery for 10-15 minutes.</li>
          <li>Add the beef and pork, then saute until most of the meat has been cooked.</li>
          <li>Add enough red wine to almost cover the contents of the pot. Cook until the red wine is a thick sludge. It is very important to cook the alcohol off in this stage before we add the water and tomatoes.</li>
          <li>Add the tomatoes and cook for a few minutes.</li>
          <li>Add water to cover the contents of the pot by about an inch. Bring the pot to a simmer. Add salt, pepper, oregano and basil to taste.</li>
          <li>Cook for 30 minutes, until the sauce has reduced to a thick saucy consistency.</li>
          <li>Add a little bit more water, then add the pasta into the pot.</li>
          <li>Simmer until the pasta is cooked to your liking. Add more water if necessary at any point. Ensure you do not add too much water, because by the time the water had cooked down into a saucy consistency, the pasta would be overcooked.</li>
          <li>Once the pasta is cooked, add a splash of milk for creaminess.</li>
          <li>Serve immediately. Bolognese does not reheat well, because the sauce gets absorbed by the pasta in the fridge and ends up quite dry instead of saucy.</li>
        </ol>
